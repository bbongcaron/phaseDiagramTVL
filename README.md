**Brief Description:**
Generate a T vs. liquid/vapor mole fraction of component A (in a binary mixture) phase diagram

**Details:**  
This program uses Antoine's Equation coefficients from zyBooks 14:155:201 Table 9.10.1 and a user inputted constant pressure P to calculate
the saturation temperature at P. These points serve to define the upper and lower bound of the range of temperature values this VL phase diagram exists in.
The vapor and liquid phase boundaries are defined by 100 data points each and are calculated by the following algorithm:
  
For each temperature in a linearly spaced array of 100 elements:  
  - calculate the saturation pressure @ the current temperature for both components of the binary mixture  
  - using the bubble point pressure equation derived from the summation of Rauolt's Law for each component, calculate the liquid mole fractions    
  - using a rearrangment of Rauolt's Law, caculate the vapor mole frations  
      
  A figure is then generated by plotting liquid and vapor mole fractions each against the linearly spaced array of temperatures.  
    
**Error Handling:**  
If a component that does not have an entry in the Excel spreadsheet of Antoine's Equation coefficients is entered, an error message will be printed
and the program will exit.  
Each component has its own range of temperatures for which Antoine's Equation will be accurate. Implementation of this range will be done in the future.
